I am a second-year PhD student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) department at [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am advised by [Yuejie Chi](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~yuejiec/) and [Gauri Joshi](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gaurij/). Before coming to CMU, I received an M.S. in Electrical Engineering (advised by [Yung Yi](https://yung-web.github.io/home/)) and a B.S. in Mathematical Sciences in [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/). 

My research interests lie in reinforcement learning, distributed machine learning, and statistical inference.
