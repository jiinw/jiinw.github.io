Hi, I am a PhD student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) department at [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am advised by [Yuejie Chi](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~yuejiec/) and [Gauri Joshi](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gaurij/). Before coming to CMU, I received an M.S. in Electrical Engineering (advised by [Yung Yi](https://yung-web.github.io/home/))and a B.S. in Mathematical Sciences (Aug. 2016) in Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). \\

My reserach interests lie in the theoretical foundations in reinforcement learning, distributed machine learning, and statistical inference.
